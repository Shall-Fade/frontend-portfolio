        <p>
          I fell in love with frontend development in my second year of
          university. Acquaintance with this direction happened by chance, but
          it influenced me a lot. Almost 2 years have passed since then, but my
          desire to learn, gain experience and try something new has not
          disappeared.

        <p>
          I'll start by telling you a little about myself. <span class="px-[5px] bg-light-grey dark:bg-crimson">My name is Marat and
          I am 20 years old <span class="text-[20px]">&#128406</span></span>. I am currently studying at the university (in my
          4 year<span class="text-[20px]">&#128554</span>). I work and teach children how to program on weekends.
          It's been <span class="px-[5px] bg-light-grey dark:bg-crimson">2 years</span> since I started programming. Now let's move on to
          the main part.<br />In addition to frontend development, I like to edit
          videos (there is even a YouTube channel with my work), work with
          Photoshop, <span class="px-[5px] bg-light-grey dark:bg-crimson">study Japanese culture and the beautiful Japanese language <span class="text-[20px]">&#128293</span></span>.
          Sometimes I play games to relax (although I don't always enjoy it) or
          watch <span class="px-[5px] bg-light-grey dark:bg-crimson">anime</span> and movies. I also make time for sports.

          My dream and motivation
        </h3>
        <p>
          The reason why I put so much energy (apart from the love of frontend development and the desire to study and work) is the love of <span class="px-[5px] bg-light-grey dark:bg-crimson">Japan</span> and the desire to visit <span class="px-[5px] bg-light-grey dark:bg-crimson">“the place where the sun rises” <span class="text-[20px]">&#10024</span></span>
